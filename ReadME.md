Assignment #5

1) First I imported the appropriate links and relavent sources
2) Next step was build the infrastructure of the JScript
3) Each major step has been commented in the JS document and provides a better example of what has been written.
4) Finally the stylizing of the project was done
5) I incorporated media queries to make sure that the page was reactive, as I wasn't using bootstrap for this project, it was inportant to ensure it's flexibility of various screen sizes.
